Ethan Jenkins: Hello! I am having trouble running by `grade.sh` script. Every time I try putting in any repository,
it says that the file is not found even when it should be there. It is able to clone the repository, but it never
gets to compiling. Can someone help with this problem? Thanks! Heres a screenshot of the symptom below:

Ethan Jenkins (but the TA): Hi Ethan! It looks like you might have a problem with the conditional checking the
file submitted. Try this link here: https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-filename, it should have
an incorrect filename. Let me know what happens.
